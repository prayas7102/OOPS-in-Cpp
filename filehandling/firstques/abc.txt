The C++ Standard Template Library provides algorithms for functions that are
commonly needed in everyday-scenarios, and for commonly used containers.
Now, I’m sure you’re a great coder and all and could write your own functions,
but you should probably use the Standard Library’s functions whenever possible.
They’re very efficient, both memory and space wise, especially if you use STL containers.
